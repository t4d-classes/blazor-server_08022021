# Exercise 9

**Instructions:** Please complete the following requirements ensuring your solution meets all of them. Going above and beyond the requirements is great so long as all of the requirements are met. Before coding anything, please read all of the requirements first. If you are unsure about anything, please ask the instructor.

**Important:** Within your group you may choose to do pair programming or choose to work collaboratively with each student doing their own project. The group is responsible for sharing code using whatever means they prefer (GitHub repo is a good option). Also, there is no official solution, just the one you all create. The instructor will review a solution at the end of each exercise. If your code does not work at the end of the exercise period, please use the instructor review period to update your code. If your code does not work, please ask for help before the class proceeds to the next topic.

## Requirements

**Requirement 1.** Fully implement the "Save" and "Cancel" buttons in the Car Edit Row component. When the "Save" button is clicked, save the changes to the list of cars. When the "Cancel" button is clicked, revert the changes back to the original.

- Hint: Find index of the original, and replace the original at that index.

**Requirement 2.** If one of the table rows is being edited, the edit row should change to a view row after, a car is added, or a car is deleted, or a car is saved. For the add or delete operations, the changes for the car being edited should not be saved.

Ensure it works!

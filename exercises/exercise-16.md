# Exercise 16

**Instructions:** Please complete the following requirements ensuring your solution meets all of them. Going above and beyond the requirements is great so long as all of the requirements are met. Before coding anything, please read all of the requirements first. If you are unsure about anything, please ask the instructor.

**Important:** Within your group you may choose to do pair programming or choose to work collaboratively with each student doing their own project. The group is responsible for sharing code using whatever means they prefer (GitHub repo is a good option). Also, there is no official solution, just the one you all create. The instructor will review a solution at the end of each exercise. If your code does not work at the end of the exercise period, please use the instructor review period to update your code. If your code does not work, please ask for help before the class proceeds to the next topic.

## Requirements

**Requirement 1.** Create a second Razor unit test file for Car View Row component. Use the inheritance syntax to reduce boiler plate.

**Requirement 2.** Write a Razor unit test in the new Razor file for the Car View Row component that verifies the event handlers work as expected. Do not worry about testing the DOM structure.

**Bonus Requirement 3.** Create a second C# unit test file for Car View Row component. Use the inheritance syntax to reduce boiler plate.

**Bonus Requirement 4.** Write a C# unit test in the new C# file for the Car View Row component that verifies the event handlers work as expected. Do not worry about testing the DOM structure.

**Requirement 5.** Run the test with Test Explorer. Ensure the test passes.

Ensure it works!

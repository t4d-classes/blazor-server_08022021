# Exercise 8

**Instructions:** Please complete the following requirements ensuring your solution meets all of them. Going above and beyond the requirements is great so long as all of the requirements are met. Before coding anything, please read all of the requirements first. If you are unsure about anything, please ask the instructor.

**Important:** Within your group you may choose to do pair programming or choose to work collaboratively with each student doing their own project. The group is responsible for sharing code using whatever means they prefer (GitHub repo is a good option). Also, there is no official solution, just the one you all create. The instructor will review a solution at the end of each exercise. If your code does not work at the end of the exercise period, please use the instructor review period to update your code. If your code does not work, please ask for help before the class proceeds to the next topic.

## Requirements

**Requirement 1.** Create a new component named Car Edit Row. The Car Edit Row is similar to Car View Row except the columns for make, model, year, color and price are input fields. When the Car Edit Row is displayed, prepopulate the fields with the data of the car being edited. Do not make the Id an input field. In the last column, there should be two buttons: "Save" and "Cancel". Do not implement the logic to do the save and cancel, but display the buttons.

**Requirement 2.** Add a button labeled "Edit" to the last column of the Car View Row component. When the button is clicked the row on which it is clicked changes to a Car Edit Row component. Only one row is editable at a time. Your data structure should only support editing one row at a time.

Ensure it works!

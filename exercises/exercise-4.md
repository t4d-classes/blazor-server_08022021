# Exercise 4

**Instructions:** Please complete the following requirements ensuring your solution meets all of them. Going above and beyond the requirements is great so long as all of the requirements are met. Before coding anything, please read all of the requirements first. If you are unsure about anything, please ask the instructor.

**Important:** Within your group you may choose to do pair programming or choose to work collaboratively with each student doing their own project. The group is responsible for sharing code using whatever means they prefer (GitHub repo is a good option). Also, there is no official solution, just the one you all create. The instructor will review a solution at the end of each exercise. If your code does not work at the end of the exercise period, please use the instructor review period to update your code. If your code does not work, please ask for help before the class proceeds to the next topic.

## Requirements

**Requirement 1.** Create a Car Form model in the `CarTool` component code block.

**Requirement 2.** Add a form to the Car Tool to capture new car data. Do not use the `EditForm` component. Simply bind the model to input fields.

**Requirement 3.** Add an "Add Car" button to the bottom of the form. When the button is clicked, create a new Car model, generate an id, and add the car to the table.

Ensure it works!

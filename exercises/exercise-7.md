# Exercise 7

**Instructions:** Please complete the following requirements ensuring your solution meets all of them. Going above and beyond the requirements is great so long as all of the requirements are met. Before coding anything, please read all of the requirements first. If you are unsure about anything, please ask the instructor.

**Important:** Within your group you may choose to do pair programming or choose to work collaboratively with each student doing their own project. The group is responsible for sharing code using whatever means they prefer (GitHub repo is a good option). Also, there is no official solution, just the one you all create. The instructor will review a solution at the end of each exercise. If your code does not work at the end of the exercise period, please use the instructor review period to update your code. If your code does not work, please ask for help before the class proceeds to the next topic.

## Requirements

**Requirement 1.** Move the car data table row to its own component named Car View Row. Notice the name is singular.

**Requirement 2.** Utilize the new Car View Row component in Car Table to display the car data rows.

**Requirement 3.** Add a column to the table with a column header labeled "Actions".

**Requirement 4.** In the new column "Actions" of the Car View Row component place a button labeled with "Delete".

**Requirement 5.** When the Delete button is clicked, remove the car row from the table.

**Requirement 6.** If all cars are deleted, then display a message that says "There are no cars." as the only data row of the table.
